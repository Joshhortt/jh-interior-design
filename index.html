        <strong>USABILITY</strong> It is a good idea to start a workplace interior design project by specifying what the workplace is needed for in the company and how it will be used. The same applies to learning environments and other public spaces. The interior is always designed for the users of the space in oder to support optimally all the activities the space is used for.

        <strong>COMMUNICATION</strong> An interior design project can be initiated by a move to new premises or by an organisational change. However, more and more often the driving force is that a company wants to communicate about its values with its interiors or utilise the workspace as a management tool. The workplace is a company's body language. It is an inseparable part of corporate communications.
